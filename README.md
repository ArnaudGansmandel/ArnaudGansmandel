- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArnaudGansmandel
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine/Deep learning models and like to try them out. I am open to hear about new AI projects and collaborations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning this field thanks to the CNAM university. I am uploading my projects/labs on this page to make a personnal code collection so that it's accessible by anyone. Moreover, I am doing a PhD in STMicroelectronics company where I specialize in High Dimensional Neuronal Network Potential (HDNNP) for molecular dynamic in order to do physical simulations of semiconducteur systems.
